# General Notes on C

- every type in C is either
	- an object type
	- a function type
- object = storage where one can represent values
	- variable = a kind of object; has a declared type
- function = not an object (shh); has a type
	- function types are defined by their parameters return type
- pointer = address where object/function is stored; have a type based on the type they reference
- pass-by-value (call-by-value) = when an arg is passed to a function, that argument is copied to a separate variable within the scope of the function
	- natural outcome is that changing the value of a variable within a function will have no effect on the variable that was passed in

## Scope

1. file - object/function is declared outside of a block, it has "file scope"
2. block - object/function is decalred in a block, it has "block scope"
3. function prototype - declaration is inside a function's parameters; ends with the declarator
4. function - area between curly brackets of a function

- scopes may be nested with the most specific scope taking precedence
	- the larger the scope, the more specific the naming should be so to avoid confusion
